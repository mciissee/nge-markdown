Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

`print("Hello world")`

```javascript lines="1"
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python highlights="1"
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
