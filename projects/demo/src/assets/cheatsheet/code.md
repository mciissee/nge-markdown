Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

`print("Hello world")`

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python lines="1"
s = "Show line numbers starting at 1"
print(s)
```

```python highlights="2"
s = "Highlight line 2"
print(s)
```

```python highlights="1-2"
s = "Highlight range"
print(s)
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
